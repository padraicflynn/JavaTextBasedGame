# TextBasedAdventure
I am attempting to make a text based adventure game in Java where you escape a haunted mansion. 
You will control a character in a mansion. There are different commands you can use, go, look, take, use, see (exits), see what is in your inventory, help (list of commands, and quit. I hope to have a mansion full of rooms, things to look at, take and use and explore solve puzzles. The goal is to escape the mansion. Hopefully you don't encounter
any ghosts or anything scary.

We have a player, and some basic rooms set up. You can currently go into a few rooms, but some of the descriptions load twice and not all the exits connect yet. 
I hope to get the mansion set up so the player can move to each room of the mansion correctly. 
After that we can start adding details, like the items and things to look at in each room.
From there we can add the events, such as unlocking a door with a key you picked up and placed in your inventory.
